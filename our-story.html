				<h3>Paulo and Tiffany met at a neighborhood festival through a mutual friend. For Paulo, 
					it was love at first sight and he knew immediately that she was the one he would spend 
					the rest of his life with. It took a little while longer for Tiffany to feel the same, 
					but she admits there was an instant connection and felt something different about him. 
					In the following months Paulo courted her through “non-dates” consisting of rock climbing 
					and skiing, which they both share passions for. It wasn’t until a night in where Paulo 
					cooked homemade Peruvian cuisine, Lomo Saltado (his favorite dish) paired with Chilcanos, did
					their relationship become serious and Tiffany fell in love with him. Their relationship 
					quickly took off and they enjoy life together following their beloved Savior Jesus Christ, 
					exploring the Colorado outdoors, and traveling the world. Paulo had many ideas on how he 
					wanted to propose, but he decided to pop the question on the night of Christmas Eve at his 
					home with a burning fireplace and Christmas music playing in the background… and of course 
					Tiffany said yes!<br><br>
					We are so excited to celebrate our love and happiness with family and friends we cherish most 
					and hope you will be able to make it to our wedding day!</h3>
